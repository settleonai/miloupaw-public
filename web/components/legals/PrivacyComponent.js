        California “Do Not Sell My Info”
      </h2>
      <p className="text-base text-gray-700 pt-3">
        The California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”) requires us to tell you
        if we have sold your personal information to third parties in the past
        12 months and how to opt out of future sales. Because the CCPA considers
        IP addresses, cookie IDs, and mobile IDs “personal information” and
        defines “sale” to include simply making data available to third parties,
        we are providing this notice to give you additional information. We let
        advertising providers collect IP addresses, cookie IDs, and mobile IDs
        through our sites and apps when you use our online services, and their
        use of that information when providing us services may constitute a sale
        of personal data under the CCPA. We do not “sell” any other types of
        personal information. You can opt out from any sharing of your personal
        information with third parties if that sharing constitutes a “sale” of
        that data under the CCPA. You can opt out of this type of information
        sharing by opting out of third-party advertising cookies, as noted
        above.
