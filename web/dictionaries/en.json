        "question": "Why Miloupaw?",
        "answer": "What makes miloupaw so unique? Miloupaw does not operate in bulk like many other existing service providers. We treat each client as an individual with unique needs that require a customized care package. As a company, we do not handle bulk services or provide one-stop shopping. Our pet care agency provides a safe and loving environment for your pet. In our journey with you, we begin with a personal meet and greet. After meticulously examining your pet's needs, we prepare a custom care package for your pet. In other words, you won't have to worry about any nitty-gritty details."

      {

      },
      {
        "question": "How do I request an appointment?",

      {
        "question": "Who would look after my pet?",
        "answer": "A primary professional familiar with your pet's needs will take care of it. It is our belief that a professional pet care provider who is friendly and familiar with your pet will reduce stress on their body and mind. In the case of emergency and unexpected situations, one of our colleagues will take care of the session."
